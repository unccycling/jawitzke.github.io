Hi and welcome to my blog. My name is Jackson Witzke and I am a Junior studying Computer Science and Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2019 with a Bachelors of Science with both degrees. Even though that can make for a busy schedule in my free time I like to do photography.

The majority of my photography can be found on my [Instagram][instagram]. Please feel free to scroll through and see if you enjoy some of it. I prefer to do portraits (for someone reason I think that taking pictures of people is much more interesting), but I also do nature pictures from time to time. 

For this current Summer a friend of mine is letting me borrow their camera, while they are off on a photography trip in the Grand Tetons. She is much better than I, and you can see her photography at her [website][afp]. She is the oppostie of me, and prefers to shoot nature, but does portraits on occasion. 

This blog will mainly be about photography, but also some posts about coding and cycling (my other hobbies).

If you would like to contact me about getting your picture taken please feel free to [email](mailto:jawitzke14@gmail.com) me. I am always happy to do commissions for parties, business headshots, graduation photos, or just if you want more pictures of yourself to show your kids one day!


Thank you for viewing and I hope you enjoy
