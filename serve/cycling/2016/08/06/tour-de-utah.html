<div class="content">
    <p>In the summer of 2016, I took the opportunity to drive out to Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. When I was in Utah the <strong>Tour de Utah</strong> (a professional cycling race that features some of the best America riders) was going through Park City, so I had to go ans watch. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="august-6th">August 6th</h2>

<p>I was in Provo, visiting a friend of mine that goes to BYU, and I had just hiked a solid 10 mile hike and set up my campsite at a local area. This was the first time I had actually paid for a campsite, and I desperately needed it. There was a fire hazard warning and unless you were in an official campsite you were not allowed to have a fire going; thus, in order to eat my dehydrated food I needed an official campsite. </p>

<p>I had known that the Tour de Utah was going on at the time, but I had not realized how close I was to it until I did some googling that night. Provo and Park City are only about 20 minutes away, and the stage in Park City was the <strong>Queen</strong> stage of the event so I had to go. </p>

<p>The next morning I packed up my stuff and drove out to Park City and climbed up to Snowbird Ski Resort and waited for the riders to arrive.
It was a pretty tough stage with a large amount of <a href="http://cdn.media.cyclingnews.com/2016/06/13/2/tou_2016_stage_6_profile_vfinal_670.jpg">climbing</a> to be done. I got there early in the morning so I ended up sitting around and waiting for four or five hours watching the amature riders go on by. It was a really relaxing evening. </p>

<p>When the riders eventually came by it was a sight for sore eyes seeing the contrast in the speed between the amatures and the professionals. It happened to be a very exciting <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-utah-2016/stage-6/results/">race</a> with Adrew Talanksy just beating out rival Adrian Costa.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a fun event to attend, and a good race to watch to enjoy my day before I made the journey to the Grand Tetons.</p>
