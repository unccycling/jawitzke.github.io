On this day **Ishika**, **Maria**, and **Mack** went with me on a walk around Carrboro
and we decided to have a mini-photoshoot

___

Ishika talking about Mack:

> Mack is such a goofy dog. He just makes weird snarling noises and wiggles his hips back and forth. He is a puppy just full of anxiety. I hope that one day he will be able to relax.

## June 27th

Sadly, it has been a longer than expected period of time since I have been able to do some photography, and June 27th is my most recent venture. It may have not been an *extravagent* adventure, but the pictures came out pretty well.
This "Photoshoot" if that is what you want to call it, just started out as taking our roommates dogs out for a walk. However, we stumbled upon upsclae yard art next to the farmer's market. 

Mack was very excited to get his picture taken. He hopped on top of a bench and posed for about five minutes; thus, producing absolutely magnificient pictures of the **Good Boy** himslef.

I was also able to get some shots of Maria and Ishika just being themselves as well as some solid pictures of the yard art.

Although this pictures may seem minor and not very relavent. They have really helped me develop my style as a photographer and increase my skills in Lightroom.
