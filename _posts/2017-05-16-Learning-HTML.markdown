## Spring 2017

A cloud and network based company named One Source Integrations reached out to me to be lead developer on their website in order to help the company's online present. My previously web development skills were mediocre at best. However, through having to build and change the website many times due to changes in design opinion. 

I still work the on the [website](osi.io) today, and continue editing it and changing the design and layout of the website. I am currently struggling with the CSS and PHP on the contact form, but I will get it eventually. Feel free to stayed tuned on how the website develops.
